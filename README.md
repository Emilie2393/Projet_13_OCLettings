**Introduction**

   Holiday Homes is a real estate website for holiday lettings.

   The website has undergone a complete overhaul to isolate the two parts: lettings and profiles, and make the script more scalable. 
   The database used is an sqlite database. The old model have been split between two new ones: lettings and profiles. 
   
   Now, the project contain the main app oc_lettings_site, and then profiles and lettings. 
   
   The data in the sqlite database was transferred from the old tables to the new ones:
   * lettings_address
   * lettings_letting
   * profiles_profile

   A sentry monitoring has been added. The admin section has been corrected and the project has been linted. 

   A 404 and 500 page have been added and test coverage is 84%. 

   **Installation**

   * First, you need a :
      * Sentry account;
      * Docker desktop application;
      * Docker Hub account;
      * Python 3.x;
   
   * Clone the correct repository: https://gitlab.com/learning2431952/oc_lettings.git

   * Then, create a virtual environment at the root of this project :  
   `python -m venv venv`

   * Activate it :  
   `venv/bin/activate`
   
   * Copy the dependancies available into the requirements.txt file:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

   * Complete the .env file with your personnal information you just created before.  

   **Quick Launch**

   Once the installation done, you can run `python manage.py runserver` in the terminal and check the application on http://localhost:8000/

   **Using cases**

   You can create a superuser to create data with:
   * `python manage.py shell`
   * `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`
   * `User.objects.create_superuser(username='admin', email='admin@example.com', password='motdepasse123')`
      choose the username, email and password of your choice.

   In order to create more lettings or profiles, you can start to launch the Django app:
   * `python manage.py runserver`

   Now you can check the app on http://localhost:8000/admin and login with your previous superuser credentials. You will be able 
   to create new data then. 

   **How to use Holiday Homes with Docker and Render**

   To deploy the Docker image locally you can:
   * Open Docker desktop.
   * Open a powershell command and enter the following:
   `$DOCKER_TAG = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/emilie2393/oc_lettings/tags?page_size=1").results[0].name; 
   docker pull emilie2393/oc_lettings:$DOCKER_TAG; if (docker ps -aq -f name=oc_lettings_site) { echo "ArrÃªt et suppression du conteneur existant..."; 
   docker stop oc_lettings_site; docker rm oc_lettings_site }; docker run --name oc_lettings_site -d -p 8000:8000 emilie2393/oc_lettings:$DOCKER_TAG`

     * This command pull the docker image corresponding to the latest tag created.
     * Then, it stop and delete current container with the name 'oc_letting_site' in order to prevent issues.
     * Finally it launch the container named 'oc_letting_site' and the image with the latest tag on the port 8000.
   * You can now see the container running into your Docker desktop and access to the app on http://localhost:8000/

   If you have some issues you can run `docker ps` to check the running containers on your computer. 

   To deploy the website on Render:
   * If you need some updates of the website, you can push it on the main branch of the gitlab repository. 
   * The updates will be available on https://oc-lettings-lwn7.onrender.com
   * Only the main branch is deployed on Render
